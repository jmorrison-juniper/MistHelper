- **Generated**: 2026-06-28 11:27:24 UTC
- **Tool**: compliance-analyzer (tools/compliance_analyzer)
- **Files analyzed**: 1

Files are graded against the project guidelines: the 5-Item Rule, no
wrappers/delegators/aliases/shims, complexity limits, inline comments,
safe input handling, and portable file paths. Use the SpecKit Remediation
Plan at the end to drive fixes.

## SpecKit Remediation Plan

> AI agent: convert each phase below into a SpecKit workflow. For a phase,
> run `speckit.specify` with the phase goal, then `speckit.plan`,
> `speckit.tasks`, and `speckit.implement`. Re-run this analyzer to verify
> every task is resolved before closing the phase.
