# Specification Quality Checklist: Automated Testing Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-03-11  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec references NDJSON format and pytest as assumed tools in the Assumptions section — these are documented assumptions, not implementation prescriptions. The requirements themselves are format/tool-agnostic.
- Five user stories prioritized P1-P3 with clear independent testability.
- All 10 functional requirements are testable and map to acceptance scenarios.
- All 5 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.
