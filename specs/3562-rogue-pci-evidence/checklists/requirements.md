## Notes

Validation iteration 1 passed. The specification includes required API operation names because the feature description requires them. They are treated as external evidence source names and not as implementation design.

Fleet note: `.specify/feature.json` and `changelog.d/issue-3562-rogue-pci-evidence.md` were not edited in this specify step because the user fleet contract limits edits to `specs/3562-rogue-pci-evidence/**`.
